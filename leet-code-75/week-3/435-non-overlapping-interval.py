"""
Given an array of intervals intervals where intervals[i] = [starti, endi], return the minimum number of intervals you need to remove to make the rest of the intervals non-overlapping.

Note that intervals which only touch at a point are non-overlapping. For example, [1, 2] and [2, 3] are non-overlapping.



Example 1:

Input: intervals = [[1,2],[2,3],[3,4],[1,3]]
Output: 1
Explanation: [1,3] can be removed and the rest of the intervals are non-overlapping.
Example 2:

Input: intervals = [[1,2],[1,2],[1,2]]
Output: 2
Explanation: You need to remove two [1,2] to make the rest of the intervals non-overlapping.
Example 3:

Input: intervals = [[1,2],[2,3]]
Output: 0
Explanation: You don't need to remove any of the intervals since they're already non-overlapping.

Solution 1: sort, compare end before with first after
    public int eraseOverlapIntervals(Interval[] intervals) {
        if (intervals.length == 0)  return 0;

        Arrays.sort(intervals, new myComparator());
        int end = intervals[0].end;
        int count = 1;

        for (int i = 1; i < intervals.length; i++) {
            if (intervals[i].start >= end) {
                end = intervals[i].end;
                count++;
            }
        }
        return intervals.length - count;
    }

    class myComparator implements Comparator<Interval> {
        public int compare(Interval a, Interval b) {
            return a.end - b.end;
        }
    }
