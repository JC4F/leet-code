Example 1:
Input: head = [1,2,3,4,5], n = 2
Output: [1,2,3,5]
Example 2:

Input: head = [1], n = 1
Output: []
Example 3:

Input: head = [1,2], n = 1
Output: [1]

A one pass solution can be done using pointers. Move one pointer fast --> n+1 places forward, to maintain a gap of n between the two pointers and then move both at the same speed. Finally, when the fast pointer reaches the end, the slow pointer will be n+1 places behind - just the right spot for it to be able to skip the next node.

Since the question gives that n is valid, not too many checks have to be put in place. Otherwise, this would be necessary.


solution 1: 
class Solution:
    def removeNthFromEnd(self, head: ListNode, n: int) -> ListNode:
        fast, slow = head, head
        for _ in range(n): fast = fast.next
        if not fast: return head.next
        while fast.next: fast, slow = fast.next, slow.next
        slow.next = slow.next.next
        return head
