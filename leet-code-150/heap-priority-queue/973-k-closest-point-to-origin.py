"""
You are given an 2-D array points where points[i] = [xi, yi] represents the coordinates of a point on an X-Y axis plane. You are also given an integer k.

Return the k closest points to the origin (0, 0).

The distance between two points is defined as the Euclidean distance (sqrt((x1 - x2)^2 + (y1 - y2)^2)).

You may return the answer in any order.
Input: points = [[0,2],[2,2]], k = 1

Output: [[0,2]]
Explanation : The distance between (0, 2) and the origin (0, 0) is 2. The distance between (2, 2) and the origin is sqrt(2^2 + 2^2) = 2.82842. So the closest point to the origin is (0, 2).
