"""
You are given an array of integers cost where cost[i] is the cost of taking a step from the ith floor of a staircase. After paying the cost, you can step to either the (i + 1)th floor or the (i + 2)th floor.

You may choose to start at the index 0 or the index 1 floor.

Return the minimum cost to reach the top of the staircase, i.e. just past the last index in cost.

Example 1:

Input: cost = [1,2,3]

Output: 2
Explanation: We can start at index = 1 and pay the cost of cost[1] = 2 and take two steps to reach the top. The total cost is 2.
